# Projectcv2
This small project was a test to see my skills when it comes to HTML + CSS only.
There are few things in this project like multiple html files that moves you to a different site
Simple yet interactive nav bar which allow you to navagate between the html files
float boxes with info about different things - "Personal info, job experiance, etc".
